# Interledger (ILPv4) Sandbox
**ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to ilpv4.dev, the Interledger sandbox!**

This website allows you to experience the future of payments using the Interledger Testnet (`mainnet` coming soon).

## Background
The Interledger Protocol (ILP) provides the foundation for the internet of Value. ILP is an open protocol that enables
sending money in any currency and any amount. The goal is to make sending value as fast, easy, and inexpensive as
sending information across the internet is today.

Like routers on today's internet, Interledger connectors route packets of money across independent
payment networks. The open architecture and minimal protocol enable interoperability for any
value transfer system.

Interledger is not tied to any one company, blockchain, or currency. We believe that
interoperability is critical to achieving the internet of value and envision a widely available
Interledger network allowing anyone to pay or get paid in the currency of their choice, nearly
instantaneously and at minimal cost.
